An application that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit is a program that allows users to input a temperature in degrees Celsius and outputs the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is F = (9/5)C + 32, where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit and C is the temperature in Celsius. This application can be useful for people who need to convert temperatures for various purposes, such as cooking, travel, or scientific research.
